# Remote-Controller-Accessory-for-Ventilators
This repository shares resources of a remote controller for ventilators with push-turn knob control. The project got initiated in April 2020 as response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, a remote controller for ventilators could significantly lower the risk of infection for clinicians, save essential protective gears and other material, and thus help to counteract shortages of clinicians and material in the COVID-19 pandemic. The repository provides a detailed technical report, hardware and software resources  which are open-sourced under the GNU GPL v3 license.

A detailed report about the prototype and a guide how to setup the system [can be found here](/Report.pdf).

The high-level system overview and an image of the final prototype in application are shown below:

The project results were generated by a team of ETH students during the COVID-19 Pandemic between April to September 2020.
